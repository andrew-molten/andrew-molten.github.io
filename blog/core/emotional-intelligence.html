        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
        Emotional intelligence is the understanding and management of emotions. As much
        as the world may not feel emotional, most of our actions are affected by our
        emotions, and in some cases trying to elicit other emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
        Therefore it’s helpful to have a deep understanding of emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
        This understanding can help to navigate your own emotions by noticing when
        they’re hijacking you to do things that you don’t want to do or might regret. It
        can help you experience emotions fully without unconsciously reacting. Being
        aware of how things affect you helps you design and optimize your life.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also, so that you can understand & navigate other people’s emotions by noticing
        what emotions other people are experiencing, empathizing with them, &
        understanding the causes of their emotions you can then navigate the situation
        more easily, connect with the other person more effectively & help each other.
        </p>
        <p>
        These are the 4 main levels of emotional intelligence:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceiving emotions</strong> - Before you can understand & manage
        emotions,  it’s helpful to first perceive emotions accurately, using non-verbal
        signals like body language and facial expressions.<br>
        <li><strong>Reasoning with emotions - </strong>To be able to use emotions to
        influence what we prioritize & pay attention to. Things that garner our
        attention cause emotional responses.<br>
        <li><strong>Understanding emotions - </strong>Being able to interpret the cause
        of a person's emotions. If somebody is responding to you with sad or negative
        emotions, the observer must find out what the underlying cause of that emotion
        is, is it a direct response to your actions, or is it related to other things
        going on in their life i.e. an argument they had with someone else, a personal
        loss.<br>
        <li><strong>Managing emotions - </strong>The height of emotional intelligence is
        the ability to manage emotions. This is where you can regulate your emotions and
        respond appropriately, as well as responding appropriately to another person's
        emotions.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
        EQ is more about understanding & navigating human emotions, while IQ is more
        focussed on general intelligence which includes problem solving & working
        memory.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>IQ tends to be associated with these abilities:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Visual and spatial processing
        <li>World knowledge
        <li>Reasoning
        <li>Working & short-term memory
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <strong>While EQ centres more on:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Identifying emotions
        <li>Perceiving how others feel
        <li>Controlling your own emotions
        <li>Relating to others
        <li>Using emotions for communication
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        After years of IQ getting all of the attention. It is now widely recognized that
        EQ is just as important, or even more important.
        </p>
        <p>
        One of the main reasons that humans have been so successful on earth, is their
        ability to collaborate. That’s how the biggest projects are able to be pulled
        off. Therefore it makes sense that being able to work and communicate with
        others is a very important skill, what use is it to have all of the smarts, but
        not being able to collaborate with other people to do big things. Furthermore,
        even just getting by in family life, and society is much more manageable when
        you can relate to others.
        </p>
        <p>
        IQ obviously still has its place, as mental skills are important. For getting
        things done and making good decisions. But one should hope to constantly improve
        in both areas for great success.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
        EQ is important because emotional intelligence is all about being human (which
        we are!). Emotional intelligence helps us to connect with others & communicate
        effectively. It’s part of knowing oneself more intimately, to know what sets you
        off, what drives you, and where you have strengths and limitations.
        </p>
        <p>While researching EQ I have been a little caught up in the drama around Andrew Huberman and hoping for a statement from him when I stumbled across <a class="p-link" href="https://www.inc-aus.com/justin-bariso/emotional-intelligence-call-out-andrew-huberman-how-to-respond.html">this article</a>, where another neuroscientist named <strong>Moghaddam responds on X to one of Huberman's recent podcasts with:</strong></p>
        <p><em>“When you don’t have actual experts/scientists on the show and have to read off the teleprompter
          PS: please hire a factchecker”
          </em></p>
          <p><strong>To which Huberman responds:</strong> </p>
          <p><em>“There was no teleprompter (I never use one) but I did consult with 3 colleagues expert in this area (2 clinician scientists here @StanfordMed) and I reached out to you to offer input prior but you did not reply. The offer to discuss your stance still stands.”</em></p>
          <p>The author of the article points out how regardless of whether either statement is true, the emotional response of Moghaddam’s statement leads one to consider it as dramatic and disregard the validity of it, especially after the emotionally intelligent response of huberman who continues to try to build a bridge with her.
          </p>
          <p>This is just one real world example that really highlights how important emotional intelligence is for how your statements will be received by practically anybody in any situation.
          </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Other skills associated with emotional intelligence include:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Listening to others fully
        <li>Expressing oneself accurately
        <li>Noticing other people's emotions
        <li>Empathy and concern for others
        <li>Reacting appropriately
        <li>The ability to let go of mistakes
        <li>Self confidence
        <li>Self acceptance
        <li>Managing your own emotions
        <li>Accepting and embracing change
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        There are so many more examples & all of these are rather helpful skills for
        working with other people, wouldn’t you say?
        </p>
        <p>
        Knowing yourself well, and how to connect with others can make you much more
        productive, and are skills that aid in living a happier, more fulfilling life.
