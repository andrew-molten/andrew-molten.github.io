      <h2>
        What three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to
        the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I’ve realised that sometimes my ego really wants to be the best - which
        can manifest in a number of ways, especially overthinking my
        expressions, or looking for evidence that I’m the best. This awareness
        is huge! It helps to be able to see when those tendencies are rearing
        their heads, so that you can see through those thought patterns which
        aren’t serving you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learnt that I don’t like to show weakness whether it’s a mistake that
        I’ve made or not communicating with the appropriate people when things
        are too much for me and not okay - Understanding this has been helpful
        because when I look back at situations where I could have shown weakness
        but didn’t, it’s clear that showing that weakness may have actually led
        to better outcomes, which hopefully makes it easier in future situations
        to let my weaknesses be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been able to explore so many things that I’m proud of about
        myself and where I am today - Seeing all of the strengths, values, and
        parts of my identity that I have accumulated over the years is
        empowering. It’s easy to feel like an imposter sometimes, and being able
        to look at yourself and see so many good qualities is pretty fantastic!
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Values influence the way you are in the world. It’s easy to say what
        your values are, while your actions might not align. By inspecting your
        values and writing about them it helps them become a clear part of your
        identity, and once they are, your boundaries can be clearer to yourself
        and others, and you can more easily live by your value set.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to have empathy because programming is a team-endeavour. If you
        can’t empathize with your team or they can’t empathize with you, it
        makes things quite challenging when making decisions, or whenever the
        slightest friction comes up. Empathy helps us to connect to each other
        and understand things from each other's shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-awareness is important because when you are aware of your emotions,
        actions, values, limitations & strengths, then you can better adapt to
        situations. If you know you have a tendency to overthink things, then
        you can actually assess that you might be doing that in the moment and
        act accordingly to not waste time. Or if working in teams is new for
        you, it helps normalise the associated uncomfortable feelings. Or
        knowing that problem solving is a strength of yours so you can step up.
        In short, self-awareness helps make your strengths stronger and your
        limitations less limiting, so you can become the best version of you.
      </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Though I consider myself an emotionally intelligent person, this
        learning has helped integrate those values more deeply within me.
        There’s always more to learn, and even if you do have an understanding
        or belief, you can always go deeper. When you do go deeper, you find
        more pearls of wisdom to integrate into your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found writing blog posts really helpful for integrating everything
        too. It’s easy to read or watch something, say yes I agree with that,
        then move on, but the act of writing about it ensures that you
        understand it at a deeper level, while making more connections between
        new learnings and existing information you already have.
      </p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Trying to polish all my thoughts and feelings. Being comfortable that
        I’ve spent enough time working on them, that I’ve expressed myself
        clearly and concisely, that I haven’t rambled on too much that it’s
        boring, but I’ve left enough story in my posts that who I am comes
        across clearly. <br /><br />I think I struggle with the concept of
        expressing myself in a readable blog post, when really no amount of text
        is going to accurately portray who anyone really is, or cover the whole
        depth of a topic. But I am getting more and more comfortable with this
        form of expression and allowing space for the reader to fill parts in.
        You’re smarter than I sometimes give you credit for.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because in most situations, there’s no use being an amazing programmer
        if you can’t work with other people.<br /><br />Core skills are critical
        for being able to work with yourself & others. I’ve been learning to
        code online for 3 years, so it’s the core part of foundations that I’ve
        found most valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even pre-foundations I was excited about pre planning how my weeks will
        look which just makes it so much easier to turn up and do what I said I
        would.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a strong framework, timeboxing tasks, analysing problem solving
        skills, and knowing when to ask for help, getting clear on values,
        learning plans, goals, learning about emotional intelligence,
        neuroplasticity & growth mindset has been very powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I already believed in or had a basic understanding of many of these
        concepts, but integrating them with my being and learning journey feels
        incredibly valuable.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        No it doesn’t feel like a waste of time. I think the first place I was
        really exposed to similar levels of introspection was on a yoga teacher
        training in 2016, I loved it. What I learned on that yoga course was
        that introspection and knowing yourself is a great source of power. It
        enables you to be more true to yourself, and when you're more true to
        yourself you can live more honestly with other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, the core work on this course has just been building on top of
        that. I’m grateful to have already been exposed to core work so that it
        didn’t feel too daunting, and I’m stoked that Dev Academy has made core
        such an integral part of its identity and curriculum. It’s also nice to
        know that the other students are also doing the core work too which
        should make working with each other much smoother, creating an
        environment where creativity can flourish.
