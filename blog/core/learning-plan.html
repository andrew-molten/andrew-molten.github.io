      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

      <p>
        Working as a software developer on projects that are making the world a
        better place, in a place that has opportunities for growth, that pays me
        well, ideally a company that promotes an environment of candour and
        trust across the whole company. Leadership.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Strengths</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Knowing JS well, experience with React, & have touched some backend
          tech
        </li>

        <li>Coding problem solving skills</li>

        <li>Communication skills</li>

        <li>Habit of meditation & exercise</li>

        <li>Committed to learning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think that this set of strengths will serve me really well to learn
        and work well with others during Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitations</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overthinking things</li>

        <li>Having to find some balance between bootcamp & family</li>

        <li>Leaving it too long to ask for help</li>

        <li>Making sure I read the instructions properly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It’s important to have a good balance between study & family for
        everyone's wellbeing. If I overthink my blog posts etc. during boot camp
        then it could cause me to fall behind, or just get stressed. Obviously
        it’s important to ask for help in a timely fashion, I am definitely
        getting better at this but want to keep it in mind so I don’t fall back
        into old habits. Making sure that you read the instructions properly
        reduces wasted time. These are all things that I should be mindful of.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Staying focused for so many hours over 9 weeks, but also switching off
        during downtime.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have really noticed over the foundations course that it has taken a
        bit of time for me to let the problem solving go once the day is done,
        especially if I have an unsolved problem that I started, so switching
        off to make sure I don’t burn out will be a big one. Which should help
        facilitate turning up to do the extra work in evenings and on the
        weekend.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Non-technical skills - human skills - I would like to see developed in
        myself while at Dev Academy?

      <h3>Expectations of the Bootcamp team</h3>

      <p>That they guide me towards the most employable version of me.</p>
      <p>
        Give me honest feedback about my work, and about tech or core skills
        they can see room for improvement on.
      </p>
      <p>That they keep me accountable and challenge me.</p>
      <p>Have some fun.</p>

      <h3>Expectations of myself on Bootcamp</h3>

      <p>
        I will put at least 3 evenings and 1 weekend day into Bootcamp work, on
        top of the course hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will keep up my good habits meditating, exercising & learning German.
      </p>
      <p>I will still spend quality time with my family.</p>
      <p>I will do whatever it takes to turn up on time and ready to focus.</p>
      <p>I will treat everyone with respect, kindness & honesty</p>
      <p>I will seek help quickly if I need to.</p>
      <p>
        I will have downtime where I put the boot camp out of my mind to relax
        and come back refreshed.
      </p>
      <p>I will celebrate the wins.</p>

        term I see my role potentially developing into a leadership role as I’m
        interested in team dynamics & what great leadership looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />I'm also an ideator, so side hustles/startups are quite possible.

      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h3>

      <p>
        I will communicate what I can do, what I can’t do and what I don’t think
        I can do.<br /><br />I will take ownership of what I say I’m going to do
      </p>
      <p>
        I will do what is expected of me to the best of my ability. If I’m
        falling short for whatever reason, I will assess whether I am putting in
        enough effort, & communicate promptly with the appropriate people, and
        see what kind of resolution we can come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
        If things are building up and starting to get to me, first I will write
        about whatever is happening that’s getting to me. If that’s not enough
        to solve the problem I will reach out to someone as soon as possible to
        express my feelings, if there is still no resolution, I will keep
        reaching out to different people.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br />
      </h3>

      <p>
        If I am stuck or having a problem, I will first seek help in the
        appropriate channels i.e. “tech questions”. If it’s really negatively
        affecting my learning & I haven’t had a quick enough response, I will
        quickly escalate the problem to facilitators. I will provide specific
        details about the problem, what I’ve tried to solve it, and what I’m
        looking at.
      </p>

      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>

      <p>I expect the facilitation team to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Challenge me</li>

        <li>Make me think for myself</li>

        <li>Respect me</li>

        <li>Help guide me to the best possible learning outcomes</li>

        <li>Have some fun with me</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Mornings: Preschool drop-off renders me unavailable before 8.45am. I can
        push to be available by 8.15am, but that is a push. If necessary there
        is some possible flexibility as I can ask my wife to drop Mala off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evenings: I would like to have dinner with my whanau around 6pm every
        night. Every second night I want to do bath-time with Mala before
        dinner, every other night spend some time with them after dinner & do
        bed-time with Mala.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />The evening schedule is negotiable and flexible. Anna also
        understands the demands of the course, so we can juggle things as they
        come up, but Whanau time is also important to me and part of filling my
        cup!<br /><br />June: I won’t have to worry about drop-offs or family
        meals as Anna & Mala will be over in Germany with family. I will just
        have a dedicated time slot to call them daily.
