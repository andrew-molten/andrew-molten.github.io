        <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I want a job as a software developer working for a company that solves
        problems to help the world become a better place, and pays me well.<br /><br />Long
        term I see my role potentially developing into a managerial role as I’m
        also really interested in team dynamics & what great leadership looks
        like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />I'm also an ideator, so side hustles/startups are quite possible.

          >A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I will communicate what I can do, what I can’t do and what I don’t think
        I can do.<br /><br />I will take ownership of what I say I’m going to do
      </p>
      <p>
        I will do what is expected of me to the best of my ability. If I’m
        falling short for whatever reason, I will assess whether I am putting in
        enough effort, & communicate promptly with the appropriate people, and
        see what kind of resolution we can come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
        If things are building up and starting to get to me, first I will write
        about whatever is happening that’s getting to me. If that’s not enough
        to solve the problem I will reach out to someone as soon as possible to
        express my feelings, if there is still no resolution, I will keep
        reaching out to different people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way<br
        /></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If I am stuck or having a problem, I will first seek help in the
        appropriate channels i.e. “tech questions”. If it’s really negatively
        affecting my learning & I haven’t had a quick enough response, I will
        quickly escalate the problem to facilitators. I will provide specific
        details about the problem, what I’ve tried to solve it, and what I’m
        looking at.
      </p>

        <strong
          >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>I expect the facilitation team to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Challenge me</li>

        <li>Make me think for myself</li>

        <li>Respect me</li>

        <li>Help guide me to the best possible learning outcomes</li>

        <li>Have some fun with me</li>
      </ul>

          >Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these
          in.</strong

      <p>
        Mornings: Preschool drop-off renders me unavailable before 8.45am. I can
        push to be available by 8.15am, but that is a push. If necessary there
        is some possible flexibility as I can ask my wife to drop Mala off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evenings: I would like to have dinner with my whanau around 6pm every
        night. Every second night I want to do bath-time with Mala before
        dinner, every other night spend some time with them after dinner & do
        bed-time with Mala.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />The evening schedule is negotiable and flexible. Anna also
        understands the demands of the course, so we can juggle things as they
        come up, but Whanau time is also important to me and part of filling my
        cup!<br /><br />June: I won’t have to worry about drop-offs or family
        meals as Anna & Mala will be over in Germany with family. I will just
        have a dedicated time slot to call them daily.
