      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

      <h3>
        How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?
      </h3>

      <p>
        There have been studies that have shown that when people understand how
        their brain works, that it is malleable, and can develop/strengthen
        neural pathways, they often achieve greater learning outcomes than
        control groups who are not taught about neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply put, if you know that your brain can develop new pathways and
        learn new things, then you can put that into practice. If you don’t know
        that, and have a belief that your brain is fixed or that “you're not
        smart”, then you are unlikely to persist at trying to understand and
        learn new things, because you just don’t think it’s possible.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Daily practice of all of the things I want to get better at: coding,
        relationships, communication, German, problem solving, resisting
        distracting unproductive temptations, breathing well, mindfulness,
        gratefulness, physical strength/flexibility/fitness.
      </p>
      <p>
        By engaging in skills daily you stimulate those neural pathways, and
        they become stronger and stronger because they grow just as a muscle
        would if you continuously used it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stick with things that are challenging, and continue to go back to them,
        with the understanding that practicing will increase the “strength” of
        my brain to do those things. If you give up because something is too
        challenging, your brain will just give up on trying to do that thing
        too, but if you can stick with it and keep trying, try out some
        different angles, try get some hints to help you overcome the block,
        then your brain is learning to engage those neural pathways.
      </p>
      <h3>Some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice practice practice </strong>- the more you do
          something, the more likely the neurons associated with that thing are
          likely to fire.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Practice skills in your imagination</strong> - studies have
          shown that using your imagination to practice a skill when you don’t
          have the physical ability to do it at that moment can improve that
          skill. Just don’t forget to physically practice too!
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Put information into context -</strong> a great way to do this
          is by integrating learning subjects with projects relevant to your
          personal life. Learn how different concepts and information relate to
          each other. Understanding how the pieces fit together helps you to
          understand the individual pieces.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Do challenging things outside of your comfort zone</strong> -
          to keep learning new things, and push the limits of what you are
          capable of you have to get a little bit outside your comfort zone.
          Eventually your neural pathways will become so familiar with that
          “uncomfortable” thing that it will be comfortable.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Physical exercise</strong> - improves how efficiently the
          brain uses glucose for energy, and may also increase hippocampus size,
          while practicing coordination of many moving parts.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Eat well</strong>, our brain uses a quarter of our food
          intake. Blueberries, walnuts, avocado, magnesium, Vitamin D are all
          great choices. As well as eating a diet with less processed foods.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>20 min afternoon naps</strong> can apparently help, however a
          great alternative to a 20 min nap is
          <strong>20 mins of NSDR or yoga nidra</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

      <h3>What is it and why is it relevant?</h3>

      <p>
        Growth mindset is the understanding that your brain is malleable and
        that you can learn anything, while understanding that even if it is
        truly difficult and foreign to you, it’s just because you don’t
        understand it well enough yet, but if you continue trying you can & will
        get there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas a fixed mindset is where you believe that other people are just
        talented, and you are not, you will never be able to do those things.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is relevant because having a fixed mindset is very limiting. It’s
        blatantly not true, but causes people to get stuck believing they can’t
        learn, achieve more, or grow. Instead they fully believe that they are
        just not capable. However, once you understand and adapt a growth
        mindset, those beliefs are blown away, because you understand that
        anything is possible, as long as you apply yourself, break it down into
        smaller parts, and/or learn from others.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one is born being able to paint a masterpiece, build things, or
        having a vast understanding of how the world works, it’s all learnt, and
        we can learn it too.
      </p>
      <h3>What surprised and changed for me during this exploration</h3>

      <p>I now feel much more empowered about learning new things.</p>
      <p>
        That the neurons, synapses & connections that we are born with are not
        finite, that despite things that we might have done to harm our brains
        or dull growth, we can actually always do more to develop & rewire our
        brains.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoyed the idea that “confidence is just displayed ability”. So if
        you want to build confidence, proving that you can do something by
        having some small wins, or looking back at the things that you have
        achieved can help you to believe that you are capable, and by
        continuously proving that to yourself, your belief in yourself becomes
        stronger and stronger.<br /><br />I also noticed how some people in my
        life can tend towards a fixed mindset, and I would love to pass this
        knowledge on to them to help them understand that they can learn
        anything too! I have told them that in the past but not with science.
      </p>
      <h3>How I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey</h3>

      <p>
        If something ever feels impossible, I will take a moment to remember
        that I just don’t get it yet, but I can learn it.
      </p>
      <p>I will remember that if someone else can do something, so can I.</p>
      <p>I will celebrate the little wins</p>

      <h2>Blending with my learning plan & strategies</h2>

      <h3>
        How will these understandings shape or influence my learning plan and
        strategy
      </h3>

      <p>
        Over the course of my working life I have developed somewhat of a growth
        mindset through learning lots of different skills and becoming
        proficient. But doing this research has really helped me integrate this
        belief that I can learn anything more deeply. I believed at a subtle
        level before, but now understanding the science behind it, how
        continually turning up, and persevering with challenges is a part of
        that learning will help me to do just that moving forward with my
        learning journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will practice these things daily: coding, problem solving,
        communication & resisting distracting unproductive temptations, exercise
        & mindfulness
      </p>
      <p>I want to cultivate a celebration of the little wins.</p>
      <p>
        I am also going to make a mini poster of “If someone else can do it, so
        can I”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe a poster that just says “Yet” to remind me that there is hope!
