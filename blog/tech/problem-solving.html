      <h2>Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      Simple problems come up all the time! The most recent one I solved was when I was trying to check if a given number was divisible by 3. I was using the % operator, which divides 2 numbers, and outputs the remainder. I was asking the computer to do the calculation and then move on to the next step in the program, forgetting that I still needed to check whether the remainder equaled 0 which would prove that it was divisible by 3. 
      </p>
      <p>
      It was mildly frustrating as I thought that I had solved the problem well, but luckily I wasn‚Äôt stuck for too long. To solve this problem I looked at the error messages I was getting. I broke it down into smaller steps to figure out what wasn‚Äôt working by using console.log() to see what output I was getting from the calculations, code, and to double check what the input was. Which led me to realize the piece of the puzzle I was missing.
      </p>
      <p>
      Sometimes it‚Äôs the simplest things that stop your code from working properly, and while your solution might actually be a good working solution, sometimes you just have to drill down into the details to figure out what‚Äôs not working, oftentimes it‚Äôs as simple as one capitalized letter in the wrong place, or getting the use of the operator slightly wrong üòÖ.
      </p>
      <h2>Solving problems elegantly</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      The most elegant solution I‚Äôve had to a problem in recent memory is in this challenge called gradebook. We were asked to solve this problem which would have taken about 8 lines of code. But we had already solved  2 similar problems earlier in the challenge, the only thing was that I had not put the previous 2 solutions into reusable functions. 
      </p>
      <p>
      So that‚Äôs exactly what I did, I turned them into functions, and made sure to call them for the previous problems, and then called them again for my bigger problem, thus only needing 2 lines of code instead of 8.
      </p>
      <p>
      It was extremely satisfying to solve that with such an elegant solution of 2 lines of code, and it also reminded me how important functional programming is. If it‚Äôs already a function then it‚Äôs going to be much easier to use it again.
      </p>
      <h2>Reflections on using problem-solving techniques</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      I enjoy problem-solving & am quite confident using different techniques. I‚Äôve been getting more into the habit of pseudocoding recently which I am finding really helpful to break things down. Console.logging is also a favourite technique of mine, combined with google & error messages I feel confident that I can figure out which piece of the code is not working, and what I need to do to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
      The areas that I think could use more practice in my problem solving skills are:
      </p>
      <ul>
      
      <li>Using the rubber ducky method
      
      <li>Asking peers & coaches for help
      
      <li>Improving my process with reflection
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Reluctant to ask for help?</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      A time when I was reluctant to ask for help has been over the last couple of years while trying to build a personal project, I‚Äôve been stuck on some problems for longer periods. I only had a few programming friends & was reluctant to ask for help because I didn‚Äôt want to waste their time, even though they have been very generous with their time, and also said to me ‚Äúif you want a hand with anything let me know‚Äù. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I‚Äôm grateful that now I‚Äôm a part of a big community of programmers and making lots of new programming friends! But moving forward, if I get stuck like that again and still feel reluctant to ask for help, then I will:
      </p>
      <ul>
      
      <li>Write out my problem as clearly and concisely as possible,
      
      <li>guess any obvious questions they might ask 
      
      <li>(at this point I may have already solved the problem much like the rubber ducky method)
      
      <li>Then having taken the time to flesh out the question to be clear & concise I can easily ask someone without worrying about taking up so much of their time.
