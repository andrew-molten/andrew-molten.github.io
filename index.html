          <p>Hey there, welcome to my blog!</p>

          <p>
            I was already doing web development as a hobby, and after some
            investigation decided thatâ€™s the way to go, so I self taught for 2
            years, and now here I am at dev academy to enjoy the structured,
            focussed learning, and collaboration!
          </p>

            Here you can find all the links to my blog posts to find out more
            about me, and my web development learning journey.
