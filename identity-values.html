      Last year around our 20 week scan for our unborn baby Flora, we found out
      that she had a genetic disorder called Trisomy 18, where the odds of
      surviving pregnancy, birth or past 3 years old were low. She was severely
      disabled with claw hands, club feet, cleft palate and spina bifida.
      Together with my wonderful wife Anna, we discussed our options: we could
      continue with the pregnancy and let everything happen “naturally” without
      knowing what exactly would happen or we could terminate the pregnancy
      early in the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one hand we didn’t want to end this child's life, our baby daughter,
      who hasn’t had a chance to live yet. However on the other hand we were
      also thinking about how much suffering seeing through the pregnancy might
      cause. The suffering that Flora would feel as she developed more senses,
      and perhaps the suffering she would feel during birth, and life. The
      impact it might have on our other daughter Mala who might not be able to
      live a normal life for a potential extended period of time, although I’m
      sure it would have also enriched her life to have a baby sister to care
      for, it may have also been traumatizing. And for us as her parents, having
      a healthy baby is hard work. I can only imagine what having a severely
      disabled baby who you know won’t make it past 3 years old is like. I know
      that there are plenty of other parents out there who have gone through
      similar things, or only found out about such conditions at birth, my heart
      is with all of them, and over our journey their hearts have been with us
      as we decided to terminate Flora with love, and we still talk about her
      with Mala who is amazing about it, she just talks in very matter of fact
      terms: “because Flora died”, “She’s in the stars”, “she didn’t come home”,
      and that’s actually quite nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, we still think that we made the right decision, and we did a
      lot of things to make peace with the situation beforehand, in the moment
      and afterwards. Of course we still wish that she was still with us and
      healthy but unfortunately that wasn’t an option.

        >Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
        your values and identity.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess there are a few different cultures and communities that I belong
      to or have belonged to over the years which have influenced me:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Yoga culture</strong> has influenced me a lot to take care of my
      body, do breathwork, meditate, and practice gratefulness. I think it has
      helped my growth mindset evolve, a phrase that’s really stuck with me over
      the years is “yoga practice, not yoga perfect”. It’s also helped me to see
      how much more we have in common than we do differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Skydiving culture</strong>, although I haven’t skydived in a
      decade, going to skydiving school had a big impact on me. At a very
      impressionable age I was surrounded by people of all different ages,
      ethnicities & countries, who all had vastly different interests. This was
      where I broadened my horizons, opening my mind to different ways of life
      or seeing things, to adventure, and started to embrace being me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Family</strong> - I come from a loving family who have supported
      me in whatever I choose to do, and given me a place to return to whenever
      I’ve needed to, and although I’ve taken them for granted in the past,
      never again. I love them all and it’s important to me to be there for
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Podcasts</strong> - Sometimes the people “around you” don't even
      know your name, face or voice. I listen to Tim Ferris, Lex Fridman, Duncan
      Trussell, Andrew Huberman & Mr Bill, amongst many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that listening to these long form podcasts has helped me to
      appreciate different perspectives.That sometimes there’s no right answer,
      but valid arguments in multiple directions. Still they strive towards a
      better understanding of the world, ways towards mastery, having human
      conversations and exploring the infinite depth that living this life can
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The local community</strong> - I live in a lovely community where
      people are friendly. We have a Saturday morning family ritual of heading
      down to the farmers market where we buy local groceries, baked goods and
      coffees! We often see our friends there and catch up while our kids play
      on the playground, and if our friends aren’t there we make new ones. Such
      a nice way to connect to the local community and have some good vibes.
    </p>

        >Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Work ethic</strong> - I was raised to have a strong work ethic by
      my Dad who instilled in me an attitude of looking or asking for something
      else to do at work. Building my own massage business & having a family
      have strengthened my work ethic too!
    </p>
    <p>I think my work ethic will help me to continuously put in the mahi!</p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Communication, connecting, listening, expressing my opinion</strong
      >
      - A few things have contributed to my communication skills over the years,
      from previously being quite shy. Streetside fundraising for charities,
      becoming a yoga teacher, & I think the biggest contributor has been
      massaging people. In 5 years I have massaged over 800 people, and over
      5000 massages. So I have met people from all walks of life, and learnt how
      to interact with them, how to make them comfortable, find out who they
      are, how to talk to them about making changes to improve their wellbeing.
      And listening to them, firstly to find out what they have come in for a
      massage for, and then how to help them with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think communication is going to be invaluable in communicating with
      everyone, to learn from everybody, to problem solve with each other,
      bounce ideas off each other, communicate about projects effectively &
      resolve any issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Commitment</strong> - Not always been a strength of mine. In the
      first half of adulthood, I dropped out of courses, apprenticeships,
      relationships & friendships for better and for worse. But For at least the
      last 7 years I’ve been in a committed relationship, finished every course
      I started, committed to learning German daily, to my business & the
      friends & family I still have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve learnt through these commitments that it’s not always easy, there’s
      some difficult stuff that comes with committing, but the long term
      benefits of committing are so rewarding. <br /><br />I think commitment is
      going to pay off every time I need to commit code to github! Jokes.
      Commitment is obviously imperative to learning, and I’m sure there are
      going to be plenty of situations where committing to working, my team, our
      projects, and more will be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Adaptability </strong>- I have worked so many jobs over my working
      life, and while I may not have become an expert at any, I learnt from them
      all. In each instance I learnt enough to be good at my job. This gives me
      so much confidence in my ability to learn whatever is needed, and to adapt
      to different situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things never go exactly as planned, so being adaptable to situations is
      going to be helpful, and knowing that I can learn whatever I need to now
      and into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Creative problem solving </strong>- This strength was suggested by
      Anna (my wife). Whenever a problem strikes, my brain starts looking for
      solutions. Sometimes we don’t have the resources to solve the problem, or
      we don’t want to just create rubbish. A recent example: as I was about to
      throw away broken scissors, I realized they don’t work because the blades
      are not tight together anymore, so I drilled out the pin, to replace with
      a nut & bolt which worked perfectly until the nut unwound itself. So now
      they are sitting, waiting for me to buy a lock nut which should stay on
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      This creative problem solving undoubtedly is helpful in software
      development, while also remembering that sometimes simple solutions work
      better than “overly creative”.

        >Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Overthinking things</strong> - I may have a tendency to overthink
      things, and worry that I am not expressing myself correctly, or that I’m
      making the wrong decision. This could definitely affect my productivity if
      it happens too much, as it can cause me to question myself, or to over
      prepare (like this blog post?). I am finding the time boxing and learning
      competencies helpful for keeping this in check at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Being used to working by myself </strong>- In recent years of my
      career I have not been involved in too much collaboration work. Mostly I
      get my work done by myself, and then massage people. So getting used to
      working in a team where we all depend on each other will be a learning
      experience for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Admitting mistakes </strong>- Another suggestion from Anna. I
      don’t like to be wrong. I think I’m getting better at admitting mistakes,
      but I would say that. Sometimes I’m not able to see my own errors directly
      in the moment which could cause tension or prevent me from learning
      something valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where I think I make up for this is that I really try to own up to
      those errors upon reflection, apologize if I stepped on any toes, and work
      on finding a resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Communicating frustrations</strong> - I’m still working on this.
      It’s not comfortable to address frustrations, especially if it will offend
      someone. This can be cultural too, right? If the rules of expressing
      issues are not agreed upon as a group, then people might be more likely to
      be offended, and people may equally present frustrations in ugly ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      This could affect my learning if something negatively impacts me or a
      project and I don’t mention it, when it’s perfectly reasonable to do so. I
      strive to be a clear communicator and try to remember my belief that
      “everyone is good inside”, when confrontations arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Working in the Haystack cafe in Wales as a chef - We would often have busy
      breakfast/lunch rushes. I would get my head down and push through it,
      possibly resenting how hard I had to work but not voicing it. From my
      perspective the kitchen felt way under the pump and I was normally in
      there solo. I don’t think I did much about it at the time apart from just
      working really hard, trying to clear all the dockets & possibly grunting
      with frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I think I would approach it by communicating more frequently with the
      managers about being overwhelmed and needing help, plus in the moment
      asking if they can send someone in to help get orders out. If you don’t
      voice your struggles then no one can help you. I would also come up with a
      system strategy i.e. that helper can plate up while I cook. Sometimes the
      reason getting help was difficult was because it was an extra mental load
      to figure out what they should do. Getting some photos of the dishes to
      put up on the wall would also help to make sure that they knew what to do.
      So I would be more proactive in all those areas.
