          >A recent ethical decision</h2
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year around the 20 week scan of our unborn baby Flora, we learnt that she had a genetic disorder called Trisomy 18, where the odds of
        surviving pregnancy, birth or infancy were low. Her hands, feet, palate & back were
        very disabled. Together with my wonderful wife Anna, we discussed our options of continuing with the pregnancy and letting everything happen
        “naturally” or 
        terminating the pregnancy early in the hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
        We didn’t want to end our baby's life,
        who hadn’t yet had a chance to live. However we were
        also thinking about how much suffering seeing the pregnancy through
        might cause. Through birth & her short life Flora would probably feel more pain as she developed more
        senses, and would doubtfully get to experience the joy that one can feel when living on this planet.</p>
        
        <p>
        How would her birth impact our daughter Mala who would not live a "normal life" for a potential extended period?
        I'm sure it would enrich her life to have a baby
        sister to care for, but might it also be traumatizing?</p>
        
        <p>And for us as
        her parents, having a healthy baby is hard work. I can only imagine what
        having a severely disabled baby who you know won’t make it past 3 years
        old is like. I know there are plenty of other families out there who
        have gone through similar things, my heart is with them all, and over our journey
        their hearts have been with us as we decided to terminate Flora with
        love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, we still think that we made the right decision. We did
        a lot of things to make peace with the situation beforehand, in the
        moment and afterwards. We still talk about her, and Mala
        talks in very matter of fact terms: “because Flora died”, “She’s in
        the stars”, “she didn’t come home”, "I want my Flora". Her raw unfiltered expression is actually quite nice because she doesn't hide behind a fear of causing more pain, which helps to allow us to also experience our feelings fully. Of course we still wish that she was with
        us and healthy, and sometimes wonder what it would have been like if we saw the pregnancy through.

        <h2
          >How culture has influenced my values & Identity</h2
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess there are a few different cultures and communities that I belong
        to or have belonged to over the years which have influenced me:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Yoga culture</strong> has influenced me a lot to take care of my
        body, do breathwork, meditate, and practice gratefulness. I think it has
        helped my growth mindset evolve, a phrase that’s really stuck with me
        over the years is “yoga practice, not yoga perfect”. It’s also helped me
        to see how much more we have in common than we do differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Skydiving culture</strong>, although I haven’t skydived in a
        decade, going to skydiving school had a big impact on me. At a very
        impressionable age I was surrounded by people of all different ages,
        ethnicities & countries, who all had vastly different interests. This
        was where I broadened my horizons, opening my mind to different ways of
        life or seeing things, to adventure, and started to embrace being me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Family</h3> - I come from a loving family who have supported
        me in whatever I choose to do, and given me a place to return to
        whenever I’ve needed to, and although I’ve taken them for granted in the
        past, never again. I love them all and it’s important to me to be there
        for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Podcasts</h3> - Sometimes the people “around you” don't even
        know your name, face or voice. I listen to Tim Ferris, Lex Fridman,
        Duncan Trussell, Andrew Huberman & Mr Bill, amongst many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that listening to these long form podcasts has helped me to
        appreciate different perspectives.That sometimes there’s no right
        answer, but valid arguments in multiple directions. Still they strive
        towards a better understanding of the world, ways towards mastery,
        having human conversations and exploring the infinite depth that living
        this life can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>The local community</h3> - I live in a lovely community
        where people are friendly. We have a Saturday morning family ritual of
        heading down to the farmers market where we buy local groceries, baked
        goods and coffees! We often see our friends there and catch up while our
        kids play on the playground, and if our friends aren’t there we make new
        ones. Such a nice way to connect to the local community and have some
        good vibes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3
          >Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.</h3
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Work ethic</h3> - I was raised to have a strong work ethic
        by my Dad who instilled in me an attitude of looking or asking for
        something else to do at work. Building my own massage business & having
        a family have strengthened my work ethic too!
      </p>
      <p>I think my work ethic will help me to continuously put in the mahi!</p>
      <p>
        <h3
          >Communication, connecting, listening, expressing my opinion</h3
        >
        - A few things have contributed to my communication skills over the
        years, from previously being quite shy. Streetside fundraising for
        charities, becoming a yoga teacher, & I think the biggest contributor
        has been massaging people. In 5 years I have massaged over 800 people,
        and over 5000 massages. So I have met people from all walks of life, and
        learnt how to interact with them, how to make them comfortable, find out
        who they are, how to talk to them about making changes to improve their
        wellbeing. And listening to them, firstly to find out what they have
        come in for a massage for, and then how to help them with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think communication is going to be invaluable in communicating with
        everyone, to learn from everybody, to problem solve with each other,
        bounce ideas off each other, communicate about projects effectively &
        resolve any issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Commitment</h3> - Not always been a strength of mine. In the
        first half of adulthood, I dropped out of courses, apprenticeships,
        relationships & friendships for better and for worse. But For at least
        the last 7 years I’ve been in a committed relationship, finished every
        course I started, committed to learning German daily, to my business &
        the friends & family I still have.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve learnt through these commitments that it’s not always easy, there’s
        some difficult stuff that comes with committing, but the long term
        benefits of committing are so rewarding. <br /><br />I think commitment
        is going to pay off every time I need to commit code to github! Jokes.
        Commitment is obviously imperative to learning, and I’m sure there are
        going to be plenty of situations where committing to working, my team,
        our projects, and more will be needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Adaptability </h3>- I have worked so many jobs over my
        working life, and while I may not have become an expert at any, I learnt
        from them all. In each instance I learnt enough to be good at my job.
        This gives me so much confidence in my ability to learn whatever is
        needed, and to adapt to different situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things never go exactly as planned, so being adaptable to situations is
        going to be helpful, and knowing that I can learn whatever I need to now
        and into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Creative problem solving </h3>- This strength was suggested
        by Anna (my wife). Whenever a problem strikes, my brain starts looking
        for solutions. Sometimes we don’t have the resources to solve the
        problem, or we don’t want to just create rubbish. A recent example: as I
        was about to throw away broken scissors, I realized they don’t work
        because the blades are not tight together anymore, so I drilled out the
        pin, to replace with a nut & bolt which worked perfectly until the nut
        unwound itself. So now they are sitting, waiting for me to buy a lock
        nut which should stay on there.
      </p>
      <p>
        This creative problem solving undoubtedly is helpful in software
        development, while also remembering that sometimes simple solutions work
        better than “overly creative”.
      </p>

        <h3
          >Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Overthinking things</h3> - I may have a tendency to
        overthink things, and worry that I am not expressing myself correctly,
        or that I’m making the wrong decision. This could definitely affect my
        productivity if it happens too much, as it can cause me to question
        myself, or to over prepare (like this blog post?). I am finding the time
        boxing and learning competencies helpful for keeping this in check at
        the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Being used to working by myself </h3>- In recent years of my
        career I have not been involved in too much collaboration work. Mostly I
        get my work done by myself, and then massage people. So getting used to
        working in a team where we all depend on each other will be a learning
        experience for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Admitting mistakes </h3>- Another suggestion from Anna. I
        don’t like to be wrong. I think I’m getting better at admitting
        mistakes, but I would say that. Sometimes I’m not able to see my own
        errors directly in the moment which could cause tension or prevent me
        from learning something valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        But where I think I make up for this is that I really try to own up to
        those errors upon reflection, apologize if I stepped on any toes, and
        work on finding a resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Communicating frustrations</h3> - I’m still working on this.
        It’s not comfortable to address frustrations, especially if it will
        offend someone. This can be cultural too, right? If the rules of
        expressing issues are not agreed upon as a group, then people might be
        more likely to be offended, and people may equally present frustrations
        in ugly ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        This could affect my learning if something negatively impacts me or a
        project and I don’t mention it, when it’s perfectly reasonable to do so.
        I strive to be a clear communicator and try to remember my belief that
        “everyone is good inside”, when confrontations arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3
          >Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Working in the Haystack cafe in Wales as a chef - We would often have
        busy breakfast/lunch rushes. I would get my head down and push through
        it, possibly resenting how hard I had to work but not voicing it. From
        my perspective the kitchen felt way under the pump and I was normally in
        there solo. I don’t think I did much about it at the time apart from
        just working really hard, trying to clear all the dockets & possibly
        grunting with frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I think I would approach it by communicating more frequently with
        the managers about being overwhelmed and needing help, plus in the
        moment asking if they can send someone in to help get orders out. If you
        don’t voice your struggles then no one can help you. I would also come
        up with a system strategy i.e. that helper can plate up while I cook.
        Sometimes the reason getting help was difficult was because it was an
        extra mental load to figure out what they should do. Getting some photos
        of the dishes to put up on the wall would also help to make sure that
        they knew what to do. So I would be more proactive in all those areas.
