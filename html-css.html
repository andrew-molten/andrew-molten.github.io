        What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
        positioning?
      </h2>

      <p>
        There are 5 position properties that elements on your web page can have.
        These are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Static - is the default position of any element. Which just appears as
          it normally would according to its display property.
        </li>
        <li>
          Relative - simply means that this element will adjust its position on
          screen relative to where it would normally appear, if given the
          parameters to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          Absolute - will position itself relative to the nearest parent element
          which also has an absolute or relative positioning, if no such parent
          element exists then it will default to be relative to the top of the
          html document.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed - will be positioned relative to the viewport (screen). If an
          element is fixed then it will be fixed to the same position on your
          screen even as you scroll.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sticky - similar to fixed, except this element can appear normally in
          its sequential order of the document, but once you scroll past it will
          stay fixed to the screen in its specified position.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In this blog Iâ€™m going to focus on the Relative, Absolute & Fixed
        positions.
      </p>
      <h3>Relative</h3>

      <h3>Absolute</h3>
