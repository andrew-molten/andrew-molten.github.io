      <h2>The 5 position properties that elements in CSS can have are:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Static</strong> - the default position of any element. Which
          just appears in the order that it appears in the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#relative-heading"><strong>Relative</strong></a> - will
          adjust its position on screen relative to where it would normally
          appear, once given the parameters to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#absolute-heading"><strong>Absolute</strong></a> - will
          position itself in a specified position within the nearest parent
          element which also has an absolute or relative positioning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#fixed-heading"><strong>Fixed</strong></a> - will fix an
          element to position in the viewport (screen) and will stay in the same
          position even as you scroll.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sticky</strong> - similar to fixed, except this element can
          appear as though it were static (normal) until you scroll past it,
          which is when it gets fixed to a specified position on screen.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Let's focus on the Relative, Absolute & Fixed positions.</h2>
      <h2 id="relative-heading">Relative</h2>
      <p>
        An element with this property may move relative to its normal default
        position. If set to relative without any additional parameters then it
        will just appear in its default position:
      </p>
      <img src="images/html-css/relative-no-params.jpg" />
      <div class="red-box" id="relative-no-params">
        <p>No parameters</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        You can add the parameters top, right, bottom, left, which will move the
        element the specified amount
        <strong class="slightly-bigger-text">away</strong> from that side i.e.
        <em>"top: 30px"</em> will move the box <em>30px</em> down from where it
        would have appeared by default. <em>"left: 25%"</em> will move it
        <em>25% of it's parent element (the white container)</em> away from the
        left side of where it would have appeared by default:
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/relative-params.jpg" />
      <div class="red-box" id="relative-params">
        <p>top: 30px</p>
        <p>left: 25%</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="margin-top-2" id="absolute-heading">Absolute</h2>
      <p>
        An absolute element allows you to position it absolutely anywhere you
        want to on the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        It will sit at a specified position within it's nearest parent element
        that has
        <em>"position: relative"</em> or <em>"position: absolute"</em>. If no
        such parent element exists, then it will use the whole document as it's
        nearest parent/point of reference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strangely without parameters it will still sit within its parent element
        whatever the parent elements position.
      </p>

      <p>
        See below, the blue box is absolutely positioned inside of the red box
        which has <em>"position: relative"</em>. It's sitting in the top left
        corner because it has no extra parameters.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column align-left">
          <img src="images/html-css/absolute-no-params.jpg" />
          <div class="red-box relative-no-params margin-top-sml">
            <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-no-params"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            <em
              >Use the dev tools (ctrl+shift+i) to see what happens when you
              turn off the relative position of the red-box</em
            >
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        And here, the <strong><em>"property left: 25%;"</em></strong> moves the
        blue square <strong>away from the left</strong> by 25% of it's parents
        element (the red square). While the property
        <strong><em>top: 50%;</em></strong> shifts it away from the top by
        <em>50% of the parent element</em>.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column align-left">
          <img src="images/html-css/absolute-params.jpg" />
          <div class="relative-no-params red-box margin-top-sml">
            <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-params"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-centre">
          <p>
            <em
              >Inspect the blue-box with Dev tools & play with the top & left
              properties. What happens when you use a negative number?</em
            >
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        I've found this concept very confusing in the past. While you might
        think that giving an absolutely positioned element the properties
        <strong><em>"left: 50%; top: 50%;"</em></strong> would center the blue
        box inside the red box, it does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        It shifts <strong>the left side of the box</strong> to the
        <strong>horizontal 50% point of the red box</strong>, and the
        <strong>top side of the blue box</strong> to the
        <strong>50% point of the red box.</strong>
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/absolute-fifty.jpg" />
      <div class="relative-no-params red-box">
        <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-fifty"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        And while in this example you could just use the value 25% to center it
        because the blue box is exactly 50% the size of the red box, that would
        make things very confusing later when you try to center an element
        absolutely which has odd proportions compared to its parent.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this you need to add the property transform: translate(-50%,
        -50%); which will shift the blue box -50% of its own size, along the X &
        Y axis. Essentially finding its center. This has taken me a long time to
        wrap my head around, and it wasn’t until writing this blog post that I
        got it. So if that’s too much for you right now, then not a worry, take
        some time to play around with these properties by themselves and it will
        eventually make sense.
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/absolute-translate.jpg" />
      <div class="relative-no-params red-box">
        <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-translate"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        While this is a very powerful property, it’s also important to remember
        the side effects of using it. When an element is positioned absolutely
        it removes it from the flow of the page, therefore it cannot affect
        other elements, and other elements cannot affect it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="fixed-heading">Fixed</h2>

      <p>
        If an element is fixed then it will be fixed to the specified parameters
        of your screen as you scroll or whatever you do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve illustrated this with the green line at the bottom of the screen
        which is hovering 2px from the bottom of the screen.
      </p>
      <img src="images/html-css/fixed.jpg" />
      <p>
        The same parameters can be used with fixed: top, left, bottom, right.
        But in this case they position the element from said parameter of the
        viewport (screen). This can be handy if you want the navigation to stay
        at the top of the screen as users scroll, if you want to have a chat
        bubble in a corner of the screen, or something like an accessibility
        toolbar on the screen at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest thing to keep in mind if you are using the fixed position is
        can interfere with content on your page by making parts of your page
        unreadable/unclickable. So do think about what effect this will have on
        your page, and this is where testing in multiple views will become
        important i.e. desktop, mobile, tablet.
