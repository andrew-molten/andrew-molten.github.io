        What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
        positioning?
      </h2>

      <p>
        There are 5 position properties that elements on your web page can have.
        These are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Static - is the default position of any element. Which just appears as
          it normally would according to its display property.
        </li>
        <li>
          Relative - simply means that this element will adjust its position on
          screen relative to where it would normally appear, if given the
          parameters to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          Absolute - will position itself relative to the nearest parent element
          which also has an absolute or relative positioning, if no such parent
          element exists then it will default to be relative to the top of the
          html document.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed - will be positioned relative to the viewport (screen). If an
          element is fixed then it will be fixed to the same position on your
          screen even as you scroll.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sticky - similar to fixed, except this element can appear normally in
          its sequential order of the document, but once you scroll past it will
          stay fixed to the screen in its specified position.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In this blog I’m going to focus on the Relative, Absolute & Fixed
        positions.
      </p>
      <h3>Relative</h3>
      <p>
        An element with this property may move relative to its default static
        position. But if set to relative without any additional parameters then
        it will just appear in its default position:
      </p>
      <div class="red-box" id="relative-no-params">
        <p>No parameters</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        You can add the parameters top, right, bottom, left, which will then
        move the element said amount away from that side i.e. top: 30px will
        move the box 30px down (away from the top), from where it would have
        been positioned to by default. Or left: 25% will move it 25% away from
        the left of where it would default to:
      </p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="red-box" id="relative-params">
          <p>top: 30px</p>
          <p>left: 30px</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Absolute</h3>
      <p>
        An absolute element allows you to position it absolutely anywhere you
        want to on the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this is a very powerful property, it’s also important to remember
        the side effects of using it. When an element is positioned absolutely
        it removes it from the flow of the page, therefore it cannot affect
        other elements, and other elements cannot affect it.
      </p>

      <h3>Fixed</h3>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
