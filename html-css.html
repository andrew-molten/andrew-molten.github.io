      <h2>The 5 position properties that elements in CSS can have are:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Static</strong> - the default position of any element. Which
          just appears in the order that it appears in the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relative</strong> - will adjust its position on screen
          relative to where it would normally appear, once given the parameters
          to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Absolute</strong> - will position itself in a specified
          position within the nearest parent element which also has an absolute
          or relative positioning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fixed</strong> - will fix an element to position in the
          viewport (screen) and will stay in the same position even as you
          scroll.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sticky</strong> - similar to fixed, except this element can
          appear as though it were static (normal) until you scroll past it,
          which is when it gets fixed to a specified position on screen.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Lets focus on the Relative, Absolute & Fixed positions.</h2>
      <h2>Relative</h2>
      <p>
        An element with this property may move relative to its default static
        position. But if set to relative without any additional parameters then
        it will just appear in its default position:
      </p>
      <img src="images/html-css/relative-no-params.jpg" />
      <div class="red-box" id="relative-no-params">
        <p>No parameters</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        You can add the parameters top, right, bottom, left, which will then
        move the element said amount away from that side i.e. top: 30px will
        move the box 30px down (away from the top), from where it would have
        been positioned to by default. Or left: 25% will move it 25% away from
        the left of where it would default to:
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/relative-params.jpg" />
      <div class="red-box" id="relative-params">
        <p>top: 30px</p>
        <p>left: 25%</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Absolute</h2>
      <p>
        An absolute element allows you to position it absolutely anywhere you
        want to on the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        It will sit at a specified position within a parent element that is
        positioned relative or absolutely. If no such parent element exists,
        then its parameters will position it relative to the whole page, but
        strangely without parameters it will still sit within its parent
        element.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see below in the first example, the blue absolutely
        positioned box inside the red relatively positioned box is sitting in
        the top left corner because it hasn’t been given any parameters. If the
        red box was still set to position: static; it actually wouldn’t change a
        thing right now.
      </p>
      <img src="images/html-css/absolute-no-params.jpg" />
      <div class="relative-no-params red-box">
        <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-no-params"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        And in the next example the property left: 25%; has moved the blue
        square away from the left by 25%. While the property top: 50%; has been
        used to shift it away from the top by 50%.
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/absolute-params.jpg" />
      <div class="relative-no-params red-box">
        <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-params"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        I want to show one more example because I have found this concept very
        confusing in the past. While you might think that simply giving it the
        properties left: 50%; top: 50%; would center the blue box inside the red
        box, it does not. It moves the left side of the box to the horizontal
        50% mark of the red box, and the top of the blue box to the vertical 50%
        mark of the red box.
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/absolute-fifty.jpg" />
      <div class="relative-no-params red-box">
        <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-fifty"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        And while in this example you could just use the value 25% to center it
        because the blue box is exactly 50% the size of the red box, that would
        make things very confusing later when you try to center an element
        absolutely which has odd proportions compared to its parent.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this you need to add the property transform: translate(-50%,
        -50%); which will shift the blue box -50% of its own size, along the X &
        Y axis. Essentially finding its center. This has taken me a long time to
        wrap my head around, and it wasn’t until writing this blog post that I
        got it. So if that’s too much for you right now, then not a worry, take
        some time to play around with these properties by themselves and it will
        eventually make sense.
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/absolute-translate.jpg" />
      <div class="relative-no-params red-box">
        <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-translate"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        While this is a very powerful property, it’s also important to remember
        the side effects of using it. When an element is positioned absolutely
        it removes it from the flow of the page, therefore it cannot affect
        other elements, and other elements cannot affect it.
      </p>

      <h2>Fixed</h2>

      <p>
        If an element is fixed then it will be fixed to the specified parameters
        of your screen as you scroll or whatever you do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve illustrated this with the green line at the bottom of the screen
        which is hovering 2px from the bottom of the screen.
      </p>
      <img src="images/html-css/fixed.jpg" />
      <p>
        The same parameters can be used with fixed: top, left, bottom, right.
        But in this case they position the element from said parameter of the
        viewport (screen). This can be handy if you want the navigation to stay
        at the top of the screen as users scroll, if you want to have a chat
        bubble in a corner of the screen, or something like an accessibility
        toolbar on the screen at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest thing to keep in mind if you are using the fixed position is
        can interfere with content on your page by making parts of your page
        unreadable/unclickable. So do think about what effect this will have on
        your page, and this is where testing in multiple views will become
        important i.e. desktop, mobile, tablet.
