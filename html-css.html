      <h2>The 5 position properties that elements in CSS can have are:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Static</strong> - the default position of any element. Which
          just appears in the order that it appears in the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#relative-heading"><strong>Relative</strong></a> - will
          adjust its position on screen relative to where it would normally
          appear, once given the parameters to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#absolute-heading"><strong>Absolute</strong></a> - will
          position itself in a specified position within the nearest parent
          element which also has an absolute or relative positioning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#fixed-heading"><strong>Fixed</strong></a> - will fix an
          element to position in the viewport (screen) and will stay in the same
          position even as you scroll.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sticky</strong> - similar to fixed, except this element can
          appear as though it were static (normal) until you scroll past it,
          which is when it gets fixed to a specified position on screen.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Let's focus on the Relative, Absolute & Fixed positions.</h2>
      <h2 id="relative-heading">Relative</h2>
      <p>
        An element with this property may move relative to its normal default
        position. If set to relative without any additional parameters then it
        will just appear in its default position:
      </p>
      <img src="images/html-css/relative-no-params.jpg" />
      <div class="red-box" id="relative-no-params">
        <p>No parameters</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        You can add the parameters top, right, bottom, left, which will move the
        element the specified amount
        <strong class="slightly-bigger-text">away</strong> from that side i.e.
        <em>"top: 30px"</em> will move the box <em>30px</em> down from where it
        would have appeared by default. <em>"left: 25%"</em> will move it
        <em>25% of it's parent element (the white container)</em> away from the
        left side of where it would have appeared by default:
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/relative-params.jpg" />
      <div class="red-box" id="relative-params">
        <p>top: 30px</p>
        <p>left: 25%</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="margin-top-2" id="absolute-heading">Absolute</h2>
      <p>
        An absolute element allows you to position it absolutely anywhere you
        want to on the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        It will sit at a specified position within it's nearest parent element
        that has
        <em>"position: relative"</em> or <em>"position: absolute"</em>. If no
        such parent element exists, then it will use the whole document as it's
        nearest parent/point of reference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strangely without parameters it will still sit within its parent element
        whatever the parent elements position.
      </p>

      <p>
        See below, the blue box is absolutely positioned inside of the red box
        which has <em>"position: relative"</em>. It's sitting in the top left
        corner because it has no extra parameters.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column align-left">
          <img src="images/html-css/absolute-no-params.jpg" />
          <div class="red-box relative-no-params margin-top-sml">
            <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-no-params"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-centre-vert">
          <p>
            <em
              >Use the dev tools (ctrl+shift+i) to see what happens when you
              turn off the relative position of the red-box</em
            >
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        And here, the <strong><em>"property left: 25%;"</em></strong> moves the
        blue square <strong>away from the left</strong> by 25% of it's parents
        element (the red square). While the property
        <strong><em>top: 50%;</em></strong> shifts it away from the top by
        <em>50% of the parent element</em>.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column align-left">
          <img src="images/html-css/absolute-params.jpg" />
          <div class="relative-no-params red-box margin-top-sml">
            <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-params"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-centre col-centre-vert">
          <p>
            <em
              >Inspect the blue-box with Dev tools & play with the top & left
              properties. What happens when you use a negative number?</em
            >
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        I've found this concept very confusing in the past. While you might
        think that giving an absolutely positioned element the properties
        <strong><em>"left: 50%; top: 50%;"</em></strong> would center the blue
        box inside the red box, it does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        It shifts <strong>the left side of the box</strong> to the
        <strong>horizontal 50% point of the red box</strong>, and the
        <strong>top side of the blue box</strong> to the
        <strong>50% point of the red box.</strong>
      </p>

      <img src="images/html-css/absolute-fifty.jpg" />
      <div class="relative-no-params red-box">
        <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-fifty"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        While in that example you could use <em>"position: 25%;"</em> to center
        it since the blue box is exactly half the size of the red box, that
        would actually make things very confusing later when you try to use
        absolute positioning to center an element which has proportions at odds
        to its parent.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to solve this, you can center the blue box by adding the property
        <em>"transform: translate(-50%,-50%);"</em> which shifts the blue box
        along the X & Y axis by <em>"-50% of its own size"</em>.This took me a
        long time to get my head around, and it wasn’t until writing this blog
        post that it clicked.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column align-left">
          <img src="images/html-css/absolute-translate.jpg" />
          <div class="relative-no-params red-box margin-top-sml">
            <div class="blue-box" id="absolute-translate"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-centre-vert">
          <p>
            <em>
              Play around with the translate properties in your DevTools. Turn
              it off and on, try out different percentages, pixels and
              substitute 0 in for one of the values.
            </em>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Absolute is a powerful property, but it’s important to remember that
        when an element has <em>"position: absolute;"</em>
        it's removesd from the flow of the document, therefore it cannot affect
        other elements, and other elements cannot affect it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="fixed-heading">Fixed</h2>

      <p>
        If an element is fixed then it will be fixed in a specified position on
        your screen, even as you scroll.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve illustrated this with the thin green line which is hovering 2px
        from the bottom of your screen.
      </p>
      <img src="images/html-css/fixed.jpg" />
      <p>
        Fixed accepts the same parameters as relative & absoulute (top, bottom,
        left, right). But in this case they position the element a specified
        amount away from the edges of the viewport (screen). This is handy if
        you want the navigation to stay at the top of the screen as users
        scroll, if you want to have a chat bubble in a corner of the screen, or
        something like an accessibility toolbar on the side of the screen at all
        times.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest thing to keep in mind when using
        <em>"position: fixed;"</em> is hat it can interfere with content on your
        page generally by obscuring it, but sometimes content can also appear
        over top of your fixed element. So do make sure to test in multiple
        views( desktop, mobile, tablet) to ensure there isn't any interference.
